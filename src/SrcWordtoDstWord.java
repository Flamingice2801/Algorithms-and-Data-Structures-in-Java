 * Length of shortest chain to reach a target word
 * Given a dictionary, and two words ‘start’ and ‘target’
 * (both of same length). Find length of the smallest chain
 * from ‘start’ to ‘target’ if it exists, such that adjacent words in the chain only
 * differ by one character and each word in the chain is a valid word i.e., it exists
 * in the dictionary. It may be assumed that the ‘target’ word exists in dictionary and
 * length of all dictionary words is same.
